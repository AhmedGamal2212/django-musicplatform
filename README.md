# Music Platform Backend - Django

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for my first Django project developed during my internship at bld.ai. This project serves as the backend for a music platform, handling various aspects such as user management (artists and non-artists), albums, songs, and more. Throughout the internship, I focused on learning and implementing a wide range of features in Django to create a robust and feature-rich music platform.

## Key Features Implemented

### User Management
Implemented a comprehensive user management system, distinguishing between artists and non-artists, each with their respective permissions and capabilities.
.
### Albums and Songs
Developed features for creating, updating, and deleting albums and songs, providing a seamless experience for content management.

### Reusable Apps
Structured the project using reusable apps, ensuring modularity and easy maintenance of different components.

### Models and ORM
Utilized Django's ORM to define models representing users, albums, songs, and other entities, establishing relationships for efficient data storage.

### Views and RESTful Endpoints
Implemented views to handle various operations, including traditional web requests and RESTful endpoints for API consumers.

### Django REST Framework
Integrated Django REST Framework to expose APIs for seamless interaction with the music platform, supporting actions like fetching, creating, and updating data.

### Bootstrap Integration
Enhanced the frontend with Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface for artists and music enthusiasts.

### Authentication and Security
Implemented secure authentication mechanisms, including password hashing and custom user models, to safeguard user accounts.

### Database Relationships
Established relationships between models to accurately represent the complex data structures inherent in a music platform.

### Signals and Event Handling
Utilized Django signals to efficiently handle events and streamline communication between different parts of the backend.

### Static Files and Asset Management
Effectively managed static files, ensuring proper organization and delivery of assets to enhance the overall user experience.

### Forms and Input Validation
Implemented forms to handle user input and validation, ensuring data integrity and a smooth user interaction.

### Generic Templates and Views
Streamlined development using Django's generic templates and views, adhering to best practices and code reuse.

### Unit Testing
Performed thorough unit testing using the pytest library to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented features.

### Custom Django Filters
Developed custom Django filters to empower users with advanced data querying and manipulation capabilities.

### Pagination
Implemented pagination for efficient handling of large datasets, improving the overall performance of the music platform.

### Asynchronous Task Handling
Utilized Celery for handling heavy tasks asynchronously, ensuring smooth operation even during resource-intensive operations.

### Scheduled Tasks with Celery Beat
Scheduled tasks, such as sending emails for album releases, using Celery Beat to automate recurring processes.

### Admin Dashboard Customization
Tailored the Django admin dashboard to provide administrators with an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing the music platform.

### Permissions Management
Implemented a robust permissions management system to control access to different parts of the music platform based on user roles.
